# Exploratory Analysis on Drug Use

## Overview
We have decided to analyze drug use in the United States. Concerned with the drug use throughout the United States, we wanted to examine ages susceptible to drugs and amount of drug use in certain areas. For the drugs available in the dataset, we have a collection of annual average drug use in the past month or year from 2015 to 2016. Looking through the dataset, the data is sorted by age groups and states for drugs such as alcohol, cocaine, etc.
